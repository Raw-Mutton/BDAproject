# Introduction

## Motivation

## Problem description

Body fat percentage = Proportion of fat tissue in body

## Main modeling idea

- In addition showing some illustrative figure is recommended

# Methods

## Data description

- Provide information where the data was obtained, and if it has been previously used in some online case study and how your analysis differs from the existing analyses

The bodyfat dataset has underwater weighing densities and circumference measurements from 10 body parts measured from 252 men as well as age, weight and height measurements. Using these measurements, the dataset also has body fat percentage estimates for the corresponding individuals.

The data is originally from a study by Penrose et al.(1985)[^1]. They bodyfat percentage is calculated as:

$$
\text{Body fat-%} = \frac{457}{D} - 414.2,
$$

where $D$ is body density. This formula comes from an article by Brozek et al.(1963)[^2].

```{r}
data <- read.csv("bodyfat.csv")
```


The bodyfat dataset was obtained from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/body-fat-prediction-dataset/). It is widely available online and can also be downloaded from multiple R packages. Since the dataset is so widely available, many analyses have been done using it. However, most case studies ???.

## Model description

- At least 2 models

- Informative or weakly informative priors, and justification of the choice of these priors

# Results ?

- brms, rstanarm, or Stan code

- How the MCMC inference was run, that is, what options were used. A good option is to show the command you ran, and a textual explanation of the choice of options

- Convergence diagnostics and what can be interpreted from them, **for all models**
  - Rhat, ESS, divergences
  
  - What was done to improve the model if the checks indicated misspecification. **For all models**
  
- **Bonus:** Predictive performance assessment if applicable (e.g. classification accuracy) and evaluation of practical usefulness of the accuracy, **for all models**

- Sensitivity analysis wrt. prior choices, **for all models**

- Model comparison (LOO-CV)

# Discussion/ Conclusions ?

- Discussion of issues and potential improvements

- Conclusion what was learned from the data analysis

# Self reflection

- What did the group learn while making the project
