# Introduction

## Motivation

## Problem description

## Main modeling idea

- In addition showing some illustrative figure is recommended

# Methods

## Data description

- Provide information where the data was obtained, and if it has been previously used in some online case study and how your analysis differs from the existing analyses

## Model description

- At least 2 models

- Informative or weakly informative priors, and justification of the choice of these priors

# Results ?

- brms, rstanarm, or Stan code

- How the MCMC inference was run, that is, what options were used. A good option is to show the command you ran, and a textual explanation of the choice of options

- Convergence diagnostics and what can be interpreted from them, **for all models**
  - Rhat, ESS, divergences
  
  - What was done to improve the model if the checks indicated misspecification. **For all models**
  
- **Bonus:** Predictive performance assessment if applicable (e.g. classification accuracy) and evaluation of practical usefulness of the accuracy, **for all models**

- Sensitivity analysis wrt. prior choices, **for all models**

- Model comparison (LOO-CV)

# Discussion/ Conclusions ?

- Discussion of issues and potential improvements

- Conclusion what was learned from the data analysis

# Self reflection

- What did the group learn while making the project
